# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names

#first_name = ' PJ'
#middle_name = ' John'
#last_name = ' VanDussen'
#full_name = first_name + middle_name + last_name
#print(full_name)


# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name

#user_name = ' PJ'
#welcome_message = 'Welcome to Space Invaders and thanks for playing' + user_name
#print(welcome_message)

# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born

#full_name = 'PJ VanDussen'
#year_born = 2006
#sentence = full_name + ' was born in ' + str(year_born)
#print(sentence)
# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object

#phrase1 = 'I would like to'
#phrase2 = ' travel to Mexico.'
#full_phrase = phrase1 + phrase2
#print(full_phrase)
