# String Concatenation

# Part 1
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that displays which city and state you live in

#intro  = 'Im Pj and I live in '
#state_city = 'Kingsley Michigan'
#full_sentence = intro + state_city
#print(full_sentence)

# Part 2
# Create a custom message that welcomes the user by first name to a game you created
# Create one variable to store the user's first name
# Create another variable that stores the welcome message
# Use concatenation to create the customized message

#first_name = "PJ"
#full_message = f'Hello {first_name} welcome and thanks for playing.'
#print(full_message)

# Part 3
# Assign a number to your age variable
# Use the built-in Python str( ) function to convert your age to a string (when doing concatenation)
# Use concatenation to display a sentence that tells us your first name and age

#age = 17
#first_name = 'PJ'
#sentence = 'My name is ' + first_name + ' and my age is ' + str(age)
#print(sentence)

# Part 4
# Use an f-string to build and display a string that contains your first name, last name, and your height in inches

#full_name = 'PJ VanDussen'
#height = 69
#message = f'My name is ' + full_name + ', and my height is ' + str(height) + ' inches' 
#print(message)
